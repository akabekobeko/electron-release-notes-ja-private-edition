# v1.3.10

* Original: [Release electron v1.3.10 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.3.10)

## New APIs

* Added a `setLayoutZoomLevelLimits` method to `webFrame`, `webContents`, and `<webview>` that can be used to set the layout-based zoom level limits of a page. The `setZoomLevelLimits` API has been deprecated and renamed to `setVisualZoomLeveLimits` to control the pinch-to-zoom level. `setZoomLevelLimits` will be completely removed in Electron 2.0.
