# v0.31.0

* Original: [Release electron v0.31.0 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v0.31.0)

Changelog:

* Upgrade to Chrome 44.
* Upgrade to io.js 3.1.0.
* The `protocol.registerProtocol` and `protocol.interceptProtocol` APIs have been replaced by the `protocol.register[File/String/Buffer/Http]Protocol` and `protocol.intercept[File/String/Buffer/Http]Protocol` APIs.
* The ffmpeg library is now statically linked to the binary.

**Upgrade notice:**

* Most native modules are broken because of io.js upgrade, module writers need to use NAN v2 to rewrite the modules.
* There are breaking changes in `protocol` module that require users to rewrite code that uses the `protocol` module.
* Users no longer need to ship the `ffmpeg` library along with the app.
