# v0.1.5

* Original: [Release v0.1.5: Delay the unresponsive message for a second, fixes #42. - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v0.1.5)

It could happen that a window became responsive immediately after the unresponsive message is sent (for example, the window was blocked by showing a save as dialog), by delaying sending the unresponsive message for a second, we can give the window a chance to whether it's really unresponsive or not.
