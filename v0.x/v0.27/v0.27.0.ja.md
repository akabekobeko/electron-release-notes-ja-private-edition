# v0.27.0

* Original: [Release electron v0.27.0 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v0.27.0)

Changelog:

**Warning:** V8 in Chrome 43 now strictly clears `Handle` when it goes out of `HandleScope`, so some ill-written native modules might crash or cause undefined behaviors.

* Upgrade to Chrome 43.
* Add `move`, `moved` and `resize` events to `BrowserWindow`.
* Add `ftp` protocol support.
* Add `InspectServiceWorker` for `WebContents` and `BrowserWindow`.
* Fix creating `Buffer` for one-byte external Strings created by `blink`.

**Windows**

* Fix crash reporter not working when started for multiple times.
* Separate `pdf.dll` and make it optional for apps that don't need printing.
