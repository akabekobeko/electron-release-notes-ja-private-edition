## API Changes

* You can now launch the crash reporter in forked child processes using the new `process.crashReporter.start` API. See the `crashReporter` module docs for usage details. [#8109](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8109)
* A warning is logged instead of an error being thrown when a remote event cannot be delivered to a destroyed renderer process. The event names are included in the logged message and the listener is automatically unregistered. [#8357](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8357)
* The `before-input-event` event on `webContents` now includes the `code` property. [#8561](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8561)
* A `forcereload` menu item `role` has been added that maps to the focused window's `webContents.reloadIgnoringCache` method. [#8570](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8570)

### Windows

* The `dialog.showOpenDialog` API now accepts a `promptToCreate` property that allow files that do not exist to be entered into the dialog and confirms with the user that they would like the file to be created. [#8566](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8566)
* The `app.setLoginItemSettings` and `app.getLoginItemSettings` APIs now accept optional `path` and `args` settings to better support apps using the `Squirrel` installer/auto updater. [#8515](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8515)

### macOS

* `BrowserWindow.setAlwaysOnTop` now accepts a `relativeLevel` parameter to allow ordering windows relative to other constant levels. [#8487](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8487)
