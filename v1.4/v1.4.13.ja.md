# v1.4.13

* Original: [Release electron v1.4.13 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.13)


## Bug Fixes

* Printing now works when the sandbox is enabled. [#8165](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8165)
* Fixed an issue where the salt used to generate media devices ids did not persist across sessions. [#8137](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8137)
* Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown when the optional window argument to dialog APIs was `undefined`. [#8189](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8189)
* JavaScript run via an `ipcRenderer` event listener or `setImmediate` call is now recorded correctly in the Dev Tools timeline. [#8159](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8159)

### macOS

* Fixed an issue where the corners of modal windows were incorrectly rounded. [#8167](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8167)

## API Changes

* `protocol.interceptHttpProtocol` now supports a custom session. [#8085](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8085)
* `webContents` now emits a `before-input-event` event that can be used to intercept keyboard events before they are handled by the page. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will cause the event to not be delivered to the page. [#8143](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8143).
* The certificate specified to the `select-client-certificate` event callback is now optional. [#8134](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8134)
* Buttons are now optional when calling `dialog.showMessageBox`. [#8187](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8187)
* `nativeImage.createFromBuffer` can now be called with bitmap buffers. [#8175](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8175)
* You can now register schemes as secure by calling  `protocol.registerStandardSchemes` with `{secure: true}` as the second argument. [#7947](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7947)
