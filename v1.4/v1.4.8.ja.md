# v1.4.8

* Original: [Release electron v1.4.8 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.8)

## Bug Fixes

* The error thrown when a missing remote object is accessed now includes the id of the object and the name of the property being accessed or method being called. [#8003](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8003)

### Windows

* Fixed an issue where the window would restore to the incorrect size when `minWidth` was used. [#8047](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8047)

### macOS

* Fixed an issue where `systemPreferences.getUserDefault` would crash when requesting a value as an array or dictionary. [#7993](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7993)

## API Changes

* The implementation of `chrome.runtime.onMessage` used by dev tools extensions now supports a response callback parameter. [#7974](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7974)
* `toggledevtools` and `reload` are now supported menu item roles. [#7981](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7981)
* Added a `setLayoutZoomLevelLimits` method to `webFrame`, `webContents`, and `<webview>` that can be used to set the layout-based zoom level limits of a page. The `setZoomLevelLimits` API has been deprecated and renamed to `setVisualZoomLeveLimits` to control the pinch-to-zoom level. `setZoomLevelLimits` will be completely removed in Electron 2.0. [#8041](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8041)

### macOS

* `shell.openExternal` is now asynchronous if the final specified argument is a callback function. [#7612](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7612)
* A `zoomToPageWidth` option was added to the `BrowserWindow` constructor that controls how the window resizes when running the Window > Zoom menu item or when option-clicking the green stoplight toolbar button. [#7776](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7776)
