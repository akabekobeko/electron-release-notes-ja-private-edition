# v1.4.12

* Original: [Release electron v1.4.12 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.12)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where certain certificates would be incorrectly rejected when making HTTPS requests. This was an upstream Chrome fix that is time-sensitive where affected certificates will be rejected starting 10 weeks after the time of the Electron release. Electron versions 1.4.0 - 1.4.11 are affected. Read [this blog post](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/12/09/certificate-transparency-fix) for more details. [#8176](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8176)

## New APIs

* Added `session.createInterruptedDownload` to enable resuming a previously interrupted download. [#8061](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8061)
* Added `session.clearAuthCache` to enable clearing a session's HTTP authentication cache. [#8107](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8107)
