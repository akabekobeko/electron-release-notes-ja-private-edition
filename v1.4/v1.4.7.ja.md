# v1.4.7

* Original: [Release electron v1.4.7 Â· electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.7)


## Dependency Upgrades

* [Squirrel.Mac](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac), Electron's bundled macOS auto updater library, was upgraded to 0.3.0 which includes several bug fixes. The new version enables [App Transport Security (ATS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW35) on all requests it makes to the update server. This can be disabled, if needed, by adding `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` to the app's plist file. [#7933](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7933)

## New APIs

* You can now enable the macOS vibrancy effect on a `BrowserWindow` by calling `setVibrancy(vibrancyType)` or by including a `vibrancy` value in the constructor options. [#7898](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7898)
* You can now specify `POST` data when calling `BrowserWindow.loadURL` via the `postData` option. Also `<form>` tags configured with `method=post` will now make `POST` requests with their data when submitted. [#7540](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7540)
* The certificate specified to the `session.setCertificateVerifyProc` callback now includes the entire certificate chain. [#7917](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7917)
* The `<webview>` tag now supports a `disableguestresize` attribute that will disable automatic resizing of the guest `webContents` when the `<webview>` element resizes. You can now call `setSize` directly on the guest `webContents` to manually control the size. [#7658](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7658)
* The `chrome.storage.remove` and `chrome.storage.clear` APIs are now available to DevTools extensions. [#7923](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7923)

## Bug Fixes

* The `about:` protocol is now correctly supported by default. [#7908](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7908)
* Menu item keyboard accelerators are now properly disabled when the menu item is disabled. [#7962](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7962)
* The check for disabling ASAR support via the `ELECTRON_NO_ASAR` environment variable is now cached for better performance. [#7978](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7978)
* Fixed a crash when calling `app.setAboutPanelOptions(options)` with a `credits` value. [#7979](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7979)
* Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown in certain cases when accessing remote objects or functions. [#7980](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7980)
* Fixed an issue where the `window.opener` API did not behave as expected.
