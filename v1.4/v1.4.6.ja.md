# v1.4.6

* Original: [Release electron v1.4.6 - electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.6)

## Dependency Upgrades

* Upgraded to Chrome `53.0.2785.143` from `53.0.2785.113`. [#7906](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7906)

## API Changes

* `webContents.executeJavaScript` now returns a `Promise` that resolves to the value returned by the specified code block. Previously this method did not return a value. The `callback` option is still supported. [#7533](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7533)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where `<webview>` tags would be cleared or refreshed incorrectly when toggling the visibility or attaching/detaching. [#7852](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7852)

## Infrastructure Changes

* Electron's V8 headers can now be downloaded from https://atom.io/download/electron instead of https://atom.io/download/atom-shell. This URL is used as the `disturl` option to NPM when compiling native modules to be used in Electron. [#7881](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7881)
* The Windows symbol server for Electron is now available at https://electron-symbols.githubapp.com instead of http://54.249.141.255:8086/atom-shell/symbols. [#7895](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7895)
